# DoubleXP

This is and addon for WoW 3.3.5 (WOTLK) on woW-Mania private server.

Its purpose is to give time before the next double XP Weekend, or time left before the double XP Weekend ends.

It's standalone, that means it does not need any external library.

## Install

### Downloading ZIP file

1. On Github, download project as a ZIP file (https://github.com/vexira/DoubleXP then `Clone or download` then `Download ZIP`).
2. Unpack ZIP and place content in the `Interface\AddOns\` folder of you WoW installation. You need to put the directory there, not the files. And there must only have one directory called DoubleXP-master.
3. (Optionnal) Rename the directory to `DoubleXP`

In the end, the directory structure should looks like this:

```
WoW\
   |
   .- Interface\
       |
       .- AddOns\
           |
	   .- DoubleXP\
	       |
	       |- DoubleXP.lua
	       |- DoubleXP.toc
	       |- DoubleXP.xml
	       |- LICENSE.txt
	       .- README.md
```

## Notes

This is my first addon, I hope it might be of some help even if I known it's limited by nature.
